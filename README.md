- To test if your Wi-Fi interface works in Tails
- Open the system menu in the top-right corner

- Choose Wi-Fi Not Connected and then Select Network.
- After establishing a connection to a local network, the Tor Connection assistant appears to help you connect to the Tor network

<h2>Step 2. If your Wi-Fi interface is not working, you might experience the following:

- There is no Wi-Fi menu in the system menu ⬆️
- The interface is disabled because MAC address anonymization failed ⬇️

- In case it still doesn't work you can try the following below
- Use an Ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi if possible. (Wired interfaces work much more reliably than Wi-Fi in Tails)
- Share the Wi-Fi or mobile data connection of your phone using a USB cable. Sharing a connection this way is called USB tethering.
